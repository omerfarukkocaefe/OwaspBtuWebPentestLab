Welcome to the OWASP Bursa Technical University Chapter. Bursa Technical University is a state university founded in 2010 and is located in Bursa/TURKIYE.</br>

The educational gap in Information Security between colleges and industry indicates that there is a remarkable gap. The awareness of people should be improved</br> 
to sustain a secure information-centric environment. OWASP BTU took this responsiblity to reach and educate more people with the help of OWASP. Join us to create</br> 
a secure and trustable tomorrow.
